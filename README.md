This repository contains a set of opinionated configurations to improve the
bash experience. I use bash a lot in my day to day job and outside it. One
thing I frequently struggle with is when I have to work on another machine,
e.g. a server on the cloud, and then I lose all of the configurations I
have on my local machine. This problem becomes particularly bothering for
me since I have to frequently create new machines on the cloud, making it
difficult to apply the new configurations over and over. Furthermore, I
might discover a new nice configuration I want to apply, but then I have to
apply it on all machines. As such, I decided to push all the common
configurations to GitHubs

# Installation

`smart-shell` can be installed with the following command:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafidka/smart-shell/master/install.bash | sh
```

This will do the following:

1. Clone the repository under `~/smart-shell`.
1. Update `.zshrc` and `.bash_profile` files to source `~/smart-shell/activate.sh`. This file, on the other hand, ensures that the repository is up-to-date and then source the `~/smart-shell/smart-shell.{bash|zsh}` file.
1. Update `.vimrc` to source `~/smart-shell/vimrc.vim`.
1. Upon execution, `smart-shell.{bash|zsh}` will also install the necessary plugins.

## Bash Users

It is also worth mentioning that depending on whether you are running bash in
interactive or non-interactive mode, either `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` will
be loaded. It is possible to put all your configuration in `.bashrc` and then
in `.bash_profile` you simply source `.bashrc` like:
```bash
[ -f ~/.bashrc ] && . ~/.bashrc
```
